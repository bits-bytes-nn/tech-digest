**CONTENT TO ANALYZE:**
<post>{post}</post>

**CORE PRINCIPLES:**

1. **Factual Accuracy First**
   - Base your analysis ONLY on information explicitly stated in the source material
   - Never speculate, assume, or infer information not present in the original content
   - If details are unclear or missing, acknowledge the limitation rather than filling gaps with assumptions
   - Clearly distinguish between what the article states and what can be objectively verified

2. **Conversational Yet Precise**
   - Write as if explaining to a knowledgeable peer, but maintain technical accuracy
   - Be thorough and explanatory, not brief or superficial
   - Help readers understand the "why" behind technical decisions, not just the "what"
   - Target length: Maximum 20% of the original post length

3. **Educational Focus**
   - Prioritize clarity and understanding over brevity
   - Explain concepts with appropriate context and background
   - Connect technical details to practical implications
   - Make complex ideas accessible without oversimplifying

**REQUIRED STRUCTURE:**

Provide your analysis within <summary> tags using this exact structure:

<h3>📌 Why This Matters</h3>
Write a compelling narrative that explains the significance and relevance of this content. Discuss what problem or
challenge it addresses, why this approach is noteworthy or timely, what makes it relevant to the current technical
landscape, and who should care about this and why. Write as a flowing explanation without creating subsections.

<h3>🔄 Core Architecture and Workflow</h3>
Provide a clear, flowing explanation of the system design and how it works. Describe the main components and their
interactions, explain the workflow or process flow in detail, and clarify design choices and architectural patterns
mentioned in the article. Include relevant images using: <img src="full_url" alt="descriptive text"> (use complete URLs
only: https://example.com/image.jpg). Write as a cohesive narrative without subsection headers.

<h3>🛠️ Technical Deep Dive</h3>
Deliver a comprehensive technical walkthrough in a natural narrative flow. Cover fundamental technical concepts and
their significance, provide background context needed to understand the approach, explain key terminology, describe
critical code sections with line-by-line explanations when provided, discuss technical decision rationale as stated in
the article, identify specific tools, frameworks, or methodologies used, explain optimization strategies mentioned,
present performance characteristics and benchmarks if provided, discuss scalability considerations, address edge cases
and error handling if mentioned, acknowledge known limitations or challenges, and share implementation guidance provided
by the author. Write as a cohesive story without using subsection labels. Use <pre><code class="highlight"> for code
blocks.

<h3>📊 Results and Impact</h3>
Present outcomes and impact in a natural narrative style. Include concrete metrics and benchmarks with specific numbers
when available, describe measured improvements or changes, discuss stated business value or practical benefits, and
mention cost implications or resource savings if quantified. Write as a flowing explanation without creating
subsections.

<h3>🔮 Future Directions</h3>
Explore forward-looking aspects in a conversational narrative. Discuss evolution paths or next steps explicitly
mentioned, describe integration possibilities or use cases discussed in the article, and acknowledge limitations or
future work mentioned by the author. Write as a cohesive narrative without subsection headers.

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use HTML tags exclusively (no markdown)
- Apply <strong> for critical technical concepts
- Use <em> for technical terms requiring emphasis
- Format comparisons and data in HTML tables when appropriate
- Maintain clear heading hierarchy
- Ensure all code uses <pre><code class="highlight"> blocks
- Make technical explanations accessible but accurate

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
❌ DO NOT speculate about information not in the article
❌ DO NOT assume unstated technical details
❌ DO NOT infer motivations or context not explicitly provided

❌ DO NOT create subsection headers within the main sections (e.g., "Core Concepts:", "Integration Possibilities:",
"Known Limitations:")
❌ DO NOT structure content with labels like "통합 가능성:", "한계점 인식:", "명시된 향후 계획:"
✅ DO acknowledge when information is limited or unclear
✅ DO stay faithful to the source material
✅ DO explain only what is actually presented
✅ DO write in a natural, flowing narrative style throughout all sections

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
<summary>[Your comprehensive technical explanation following the structure above]</summary>
<tags>[5-7 specific technical topics in Title Case, comma-separated - focus on distinctive technologies, methodologies,
or architectural patterns explicitly mentioned in the article - avoid generic terms like "Machine Learning" or "AI"

blocks.

<h3>📊 성과 및 비즈니스 임팩트</h3>
Present outcomes and impact in a natural narrative style. Include concrete metrics and benchmarks with specific numbers
when available, describe measured improvements or changes, discuss stated business value or practical benefits, and
mention cost implications or resource savings if quantified. Write as a flowing explanation without creating
subsections.

<h3>🔮 향후 발전 가능성과 기회</h3>
Explore forward-looking aspects in a conversational narrative. Discuss evolution paths or next steps explicitly
mentioned, describe integration possibilities or use cases discussed in the article, and acknowledge limitations or
future work mentioned by the author. Write as a cohesive narrative without subsection headers.

**FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:**
- Use HTML tags exclusively (no markdown)
- Apply <strong> for critical technical concepts
- Use <em> for technical terms requiring emphasis
- Format comparisons and data in HTML tables when appropriate
- Maintain clear heading hierarchy
- Ensure all code uses <pre><code class="highlight"> blocks
- Make technical explanations accessible but accurate
- Write content in Korean while keeping proper nouns and difficult-to-translate technical concepts in English

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
❌ DO NOT speculate about information not in the article
❌ DO NOT assume unstated technical details
❌ DO NOT infer motivations or context not explicitly provided
❌ DO NOT add examples or scenarios not in the original content
❌ DO NOT include meta-commentary about following these instructions
❌ DO NOT create subsection headers within the main sections (e.g., "Core Concepts:", "Integration Possibilities:",
"Known Limitations:")
❌ DO NOT structure content with labels like "통합 가능성:", "한계점 인식:", "명시된 향후 계획:", "기술적 진화 방향:"
✅ DO acknowledge when information is limited or unclear
✅ DO stay faithful to the source material
✅ DO explain only what is actually presented
✅ DO write in a natural, flowing narrative style throughout all sections

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
<summary>[Your comprehensive technical explanation in Korean following the structure above]</summary>
<tags>[5-7 specific technical topics in Title Case, comma-separated - focus on distinctive technologies, methodologies,
or architectural patterns explicitly mentioned in the article - avoid generic terms like "Machine Learning" or "AI"
unless they represent novel approaches discussed - write all titles in English]</tags>
<urls>[Essential technical references as HTML links: <a href="url1">Descriptive Title 1</a>, <a href="url2">Descriptive
Title 2</a> - include only URLs explicitly mentioned or directly referenced in the article - write all titles in
English]</urls>""",
